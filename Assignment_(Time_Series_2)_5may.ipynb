In traditional time series analysis, seasonal components are often assumed to be constant or fixed across different periods within a year. However, in some cases, the seasonal patterns may not remain constant but exhibit variations that are related to time or external factors.\n",

These factors can include changes in consumer behavior, shifts in environmental conditions, evolving market dynamics, or external events impacting the seasonality of the data.\n",

Initially, the store may observe a regular seasonal pattern where sales peak during the holiday season in December. However, over time, the introduction of new marketing strategies, changing customer preferences, or economic factors may lead to shifting seasonal patterns. The peak sales period may gradually shift earlier or later in the year, or the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations may change.\n",
