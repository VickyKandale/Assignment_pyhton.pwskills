The idea behind ensemble methods is that combining the predictions of multiple models can often lead to better overall performance compared to using a single model.\n",

Each individual model in an ensemble is often referred to as a \"base model\" or \"weak learner,\" and the combination of these models is known as the \"ensemble model\" or \"strong learner.\"\n",

        "\n",
        "`Improved accuracy and generalization:` Ensemble methods can often achieve higher accuracy and generalization performance compared to individual models. By combining the predictions of multiple models, ensemble techniques reduce the impact of individual model biases and errors, leading to more reliable and robust predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "`Reduction of overfitting:` Ensemble methods are effective in reducing overfitting, which occurs when a model becomes too complex and performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to unseen data. Ensembles combine multiple models with different strengths and weaknesses, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting and improving performance on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "`Capturing a broader range of patterns:` Ensemble techniques have the ability to capture a wider range of patterns and relationships in the data. Different models in an ensemble may focus on different subsets of features or learn different aspects of the data, resulting in a more comprehensive representation of the underlying patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "`Stability and robustness:` Ensembles are often more stable and robust compared to individual models. They are less sensitive to small changes in the training data or noise and tend to produce more consistent and reliable predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "`Combining diverse models:` Ensemble techniques allow for the combination of diverse models, such as different algorithms, architectures, or hyperparameter settings. By leveraging the strengths of different models, ensembles can overcome individual model limitations and achieve better overall performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "`Handling complex problems:` Ensemble techniques are particularly useful in tackling complex problems where a single model may struggle to capture all the intricacies and variations in the data. By leveraging the collective intelligence of multiple models, ensembles can provide better solutions for challenging tasks.\n",

        "Overall, ensemble techniques are employed in machine learning to enhance accuracy, improve generalization, reduce overfitting, increase robustness, and handle complex problems.

The base model can be any learning algorithm capable of making predictions, such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks. Each base model is trained on a different subset of the data, which introduces diversity into the ensemble.\n",

        "`Sequential model training and weight adjustment:` Models are trained sequentially, with each subsequent model focusing more on the instances that the previous models struggled to predict correctly.
