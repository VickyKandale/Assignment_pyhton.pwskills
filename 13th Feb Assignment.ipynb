    "We use the Exception class as the base class when creating custom exceptions because it provides a standard interface and behavior for all types of exceptions in Python. The Exception class defines methods like __init__(), __str__(), and __repr__() that are used to initialize and represent an exception object.\n",

    "Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Be specific: Catch only the exceptions you expect and can handle. Avoid catching Exception or BaseException unless you have a good reason to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use try-except blocks sparingly: Don't use try-except blocks to control the flow of your program. Exceptions should be used to handle unexpected errors, not to control program flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle exceptions at the appropriate level: Catch exceptions at the level of the program where you can handle them most effectively. Don't catch an exception at a lower level if you can't handle it there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide useful error messages: When an exception occurs, provide a helpful error message that explains what went wrong and how to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't ignore exceptions: Never ignore exceptions. Even if you can't handle an exception, you should at least log it so that you can debug the problem later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use context managers: Use context managers (with statements) to ensure that resources are properly cleaned up, even in the case of an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid catching KeyboardInterrupt: Avoid catching KeyboardInterrupt unless you have a good reason to do so. This exception is raised when the user presses Ctrl+C to interrupt the program, and it should be allowed to propagate to the top level so that the program can cleanly exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use custom exceptions: Use custom exceptions to communicate more specific error conditions to callers of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test exception handling: Test your code's exception handling by writing unit tests that intentionally raise exceptions and verifying that they are caught and handled properly."
