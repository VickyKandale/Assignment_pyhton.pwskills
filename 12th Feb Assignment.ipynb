    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, the normal flow of execution is interrupted and the program terminates unless the exception is handled properly using try-except blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur due to various reasons such as invalid input, unexpected conditions, insufficient resources, or programming errors. Python provides built-in exceptions for different types of errors, and users can also create custom exceptions as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur when the Python interpreter is unable to parse a program due to incorrect syntax. Syntax errors are usually detected during the compilation of the code and cause the program to fail before it even starts running. Common syntax errors include missing parentheses or quotation marks, incorrect indentation, and misspelled keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors occur due to mistakes in the code's syntax, whereas exceptions occur during the execution of the program due to unexpected conditions or errors in the logic of the program. Additionally, syntax errors are usually detected during the compilation of the code, while exceptions are detected during the runtime of the program. Finally, while syntax errors cause the program to fail before it starts running, exceptions can be caught and handled during runtime, allowing the program to continue executing."
