However, in addition to this, Ridge Regression also aims to minimize the sum of the squared values of the regression coefficients. This is achieved by adding a penalty term to the objective function that includes a tuning parameter, often represented by the symbol lambda (λ). The higher the value of λ, the greater the penalty, and the smaller the regression coefficients will be.\n",
