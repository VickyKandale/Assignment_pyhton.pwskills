        "\n",
        "The filter method works by evaluating each feature based on a statistical measure or score, and then ranking them according to their importance. The most important features are then selected and used for building the model. This approach is called the filter method because it filters out irrelevant features before building the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several statistical measures that can be used to score the relevance of a feature, such as correlation, mutual information, and chi-squared test. Correlation measures the linear relationship between two variables, while mutual information measures the amount of information that one variable provides about another. Chi-squared test measures the dependence between two categorical variables.\n",

        "Once the statistical measure is chosen, the filter method computes the score for each feature and ranks them according to their importance. The top-k features with the highest scores are then selected and used for building the model. The value of k is usually determined by trial and error or by using a validation set.\n",

        "The wrapper method works by using a search algorithm to find the best subset of features that optimizes the performance of the model. The search algorithm starts with an empty set of features and iteratively adds or removes features based on their impact on the model's performance. The performance of the model is measured by a performance metric, such as accuracy or mean squared error.\n",

Additionally, the wrapper method is more flexible and can be used with any machine learning algorithm.\n",

        "Some common techniques used in embedded feature selection methods are:\n",
        "\n",
        "`Lasso regularization:` Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a regularization technique that adds a penalty term to the objective function of the model to encourage sparsity, which means that some of the model's coefficients are set to zero, effectively eliminating the corresponding features. Lasso is commonly used in linear regression and logistic regression models.\n",
        "\n",
        "`Ridge regularization:` Ridge regularization is another form of regularization that adds a penalty term to the objective function of the model to shrink the coefficients towards zero. Unlike Lasso, Ridge does not result in sparsity, but it can be used to reduce the impact of irrelevant features and prevent overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "`Elastic Net regularization:` Elastic Net is a combination of Lasso and Ridge regularization that adds both penalties to the objective function of the model. This method is useful when there are groups of correlated features that should be selected or eliminated together.\n",
        "\n",
        "`Decision tree-based methods:` Decision tree algorithms, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees, can also perform feature selection as part of the model building process. These algorithms can evaluate the importance of each feature based on how much they contribute to reducing the impurity or error of the tree.\n",

        "Embedded feature selection methods are often more effective than filter and wrapper methods because they can capture complex relationships between features and the target variable, and they can be optimized along with the model's parameters during training.

This means that it can only capture linear relationships between features and the target variable, and it may miss more complex relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "`Ignores feature interactions:` The Filter method does not consider the interactions between features, which can be important for predicting the target variable. For example, two features may not be very informative on their own, but together they can provide valuable information.\n",
        "\n",
        "`Ignores the impact of the model:` The Filter method selects the most relevant features based on a statistical measure, without considering the impact of the model on the selected features. This means that the selected features may not be optimal for a given model or algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "`Does not account for redundancy:` The Filter method may select redundant features that are highly correlated with each other, which can lead to overfitting and reduce the interpretability of the model.\n",
