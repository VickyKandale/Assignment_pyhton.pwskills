        "Here are a few reasons why a pair confusion matrix might be useful in certain situations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Imbalanced Classes: When dealing with imbalanced classes, a regular confusion matrix may not provide sufficient information about the performance of the classifier. A pair confusion matrix allows you to evaluate the classifier's performance on specific class pairs of interest, regardless of the overall class distribution.\n",

By using a pair confusion matrix, you can focus on those specific class pairs and gain insights into the classifier's performance on those important distinctions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Error Analysis: The pair confusion matrix can help identify specific types of errors made by the classifier. By examining the off-diagonal cells (cells that represent misclassifications), you can gain insights into the specific class pairs that are commonly confused, which can guide further analysis and potential improvements in the model.\n",

        "- Decision Threshold Selection: In some classification problems, adjusting the decision threshold can significantly impact the classifier's performance on different class pairs. By analyzing the pair confusion matrix at different decision thresholds, you can identify the optimal threshold for a specific class pair or gain a better understanding of the trade-offs between different pairs.\n",
