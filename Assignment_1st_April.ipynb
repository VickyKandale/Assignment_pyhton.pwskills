The goal of linear regression is to fit a linear equation to the data that can be used to make predictions about the dependent variable. For example, linear regression can be used to predict the price of a house based on its size, location, and other features.\n",

The dependent variable in logistic regression is binary, meaning it can only take two values (e.g. 0 or 1). The goal of logistic regression is to fit a logistic function to the data that can be used to predict the probability of the dependent variable taking on a particular value. For example, logistic regression can be used to predict whether a customer will buy a product based on their demographic and purchase history.\n",

In this case, the dependent variable (churn or not churn) is binary, and the independent variables may include the customer's demographic information, usage patterns, and customer service history. Logistic regression can be used to model the relationship between these variables and the probability of churn, allowing the company to identify customers who are at a higher risk of churn and take proactive measures to retain them."
