        "Lasso regression, also known as L1 regularization, is a type of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression objective function. This penalty term is the sum of the absolute values of the regression coefficients, multiplied by a tuning parameter (lambda).\n",
        "\n",
        "The main difference between lasso regression and other regression techniques, such as ridge regression or OLS regression, is the type of regularization applied to the regression coefficients. In ridge regression, L2 regularization is applied, which adds a penalty term that is the sum of the squared values of the regression coefficients. This results in a model that shrinks the coefficients towards zero, but does not eliminate them entirely. In contrast, lasso regression applies L1 regularization, which can result in some coefficients being set exactly to zero. This can be useful for feature selection, as it allows the most important predictors to be selected automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another difference between lasso regression and other regression techniques is the shape of the constraint region in which the optimal solution must lie. In lasso regression, the constraint region is a diamond shape, while in ridge regression, the constraint region is a sphere. This difference in shape can lead to differences in the optimal solutions obtained using each technique.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lasso regression is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data, where the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations. In such cases, lasso regression can help to identify the most important predictors and eliminate the less important ones, thus reducing overfitting and improving prediction performance.\n",

This results in a more parsimonious model with fewer predictors and improved interpretability.\n",

        "Lasso regression is a linear regression technique that performs both variable selection and regularization to improve the model's performance. The Lasso regression model involves a penalty parameter that controls the strength of the regularization, and this penalty parameter can be tuned to achieve better model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The tuning parameter in Lasso regression is known as alpha (Î±), which controls the amount of regularization applied to the model. A higher value of alpha will increase the regularization, resulting in a simpler model with fewer features. On the other hand, a lower value of alpha will decrease the regularization, allowing more features to be included in the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The effect of alpha on the Lasso regression model's performance can be observed through its impact on the coefficients of the variables. A higher value of alpha leads to more shrinkage of the coefficients, and some coefficients may become zero, effectively removing the corresponding variables from the model. This can help to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to alpha, another important parameter in Lasso regression is the maximum number of iterations for the algorithm to converge, known as the max_iter parameter. This parameter controls the number of iterations the optimization algorithm will perform before terminating, and it can be adjusted to balance computational efficiency with model accuracy.\n",
        "\n",

        "In Lasso Regression, the coefficients of the model represent the importance and contribution of each predictor variable in explaining the variation in the response variable. The coefficients are estimated by minimizing the sum of squared errors subject to the L1 constraint or penalty, which imposes sparsity in the model by shrinking some coefficients to zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "The interpretation of the coefficients in a Lasso Regression model is similar to that of a standard linear regression model. A positive coefficient indicates that an increase in the predictor variable's value leads to an increase in the response variable's value, while a negative coefficient indicates that an increase in the predictor variable's value leads to a decrease in the response variable's value.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the coefficients in a Lasso Regression model have additional implications due to the L1 constraint, which promotes sparsity in the model. If a coefficient is zero, it means that the corresponding predictor variable has been completely excluded from the model, and hence, it does not contribute to explaining the variation in the response variable. In other words, a zero coefficient suggests that the predictor variable is not useful in predicting the response variable.\n",
