This means that the central tendency of a normal distribution is characterized by a single value, which represents the peak of the distribution and is located at the center of the distribution. The mean, median, and mode are all measures of central tendency that describe different aspects of the distribution. The mean is the arithmetic average of the data, the median is the middle value when the data is arranged in order, and the mode is the most frequent value in the data. In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal because the distribution is symmetrical around its center."

        "\n",
        "Covariance measures the extent to which two variables vary together. It is a measure of the linear association between two variables and can be positive, negative, or zero. A positive covariance indicates that two variables move together, a negative covariance indicates that two variables move in opposite directions, and a covariance of zero indicates that there is no linear relationship between the variables. However, the magnitude of the covariance is not standardized and depends on the scale of measurement of the variables.\n",

        "On the other hand, correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, but it is scaled between -1 and 1. A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect positive relationship, a correlation of 0 indicates no relationship, and a correlation of -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship. Correlation is calculated as the covariance between two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. The use of standard deviations in the calculation of correlation makes it possible to compare the strength of the relationship between variables measured in different units.\n",

        "\n",
        "In terms of measures of central tendency, outliers can greatly affect the mean, but have little impact on the median and mode. Since the mean is sensitive to extreme values, the presence of outliers can shift the mean towards their direction. For example, consider a dataset of test scores for a class of students: 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100. The mean score is 75. However, if an outlier of 20 is added to the dataset, the mean drops to 65. In this case, the outlier had a significant impact on the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of measures of dispersion, outliers can greatly affect the range and standard deviation, but have little impact on the interquartile range. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset, and the presence of an outlier can greatly increase the range. Similarly, the standard deviation is sensitive to extreme values, so the presence of outliers can increase the standard deviation. For example, consider a dataset of salaries for employees at a company: $30,000, $35,000, $40,000, $45,000, $50,000, $100,000. The presence of the outlier of $100,000 greatly increases the range and standard deviation of the dataset.\n",

        "In summary, outliers can have a significant impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion, particularly the mean, range, and standard deviation. It is important to identify and address outliers in a dataset before interpreting these measures."
