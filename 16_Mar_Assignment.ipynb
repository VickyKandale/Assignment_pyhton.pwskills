Overfitting can lead to poor performance on the validation or test data, as the model may have memorized the training data rather than learned general patterns.\n",

Another approach is to use early stopping, where the training process is stopped when the model's performance on a validation set starts to degrade. Data augmentation techniques such as dropout, data shuffling, and adding noise to the input can also help in reducing overfitting.\n",
